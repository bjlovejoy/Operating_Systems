1.  Delete main code (MADLIBS)
2.  Will be adding 4 new functions (place before handleInterrupt21() )
3.  Also add interrupt calls to these functions

*****************************************************************
//read consecutive disk sectors
readSector(bx, cx, dx)

Use BIOS interrupt 19
Use parameters and equations at the bottom of page 1 and top of 2
Need AX, CX and DX
Need relSecNo, headNo and trackNo (need to use MOD and DIV functions)

Pass character array of 512 bytes or more, an absolute section number
to begin reading at and the number of sectors to read

Function will compute relative sector, head and track and will also
call interrupt 19 (not sure if DEC or HEX 19)

Add to main function
After compiling kernel.c and rebuilding floppy.img, run

dd if=msg of=floppya.img bs=512 count=1 seek=30 conv=notrunc

Now run bochs and if message prints out, it works

*****************************************************************

//write consecutive disk sectors
writeSector(bx, cx, dx)

Almost identical to readSector(), but AX = 768 + sectorCount

Should work fine if readSector() does

*****************************************************************

//clear screen and set colors
clearScreen(bx, cx)

Will do 3 things:
1.  Make 24 carriage return/newline combos (use interrupt 16 calls to place
                                            individual characters)
2.  Issue command interrupt(15, 512, 0, 0, 0);
3.  If bx and cx > 0, execute:
        interrupt(16, 1536, 4096 * (bx – 1) + 256 * (cx – 1), 0, 6223);

Explanation:
BIOS function 16/2 puts cursor in top left corner after existing text
has been cleared
BIOS function 16/6 scrolls the window with parameters listed towards the
bottom middle of page 3

The attribute byte (bolded) describes color and intensity of subsequent characters as well as background color.
Here, bx = background color and cx = character/foreground color.
Zero values will mean no change.
Colors are shown in table at bottom of page 3.

If bx is larger than 8 or cx is larger than 16, make no change to
the color scheme.
(Remember that values passed in are one larger than those in table)
---Decrement---

FINAL TEST CASE
